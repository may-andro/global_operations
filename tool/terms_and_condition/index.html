    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
</header>

<main class="container">
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Global NL app ("Application") for mobile devices,
        created by Global ("Service Provider") as a free service.</p>

    <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to the following terms. Please read them
        carefully. Unauthorized copying, modifying, translating, or reverse engineering of the
        Application is prohibited. All rights remain with the Service Provider.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to modify the Application or charge for its services
        at any time. Charges will be clearly communicated if applied.</p>

    <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service
        Provider
        in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your
        phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against
        jailbreaking
        or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
        by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to
        malware,
        viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in
        the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms & Conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
            Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connectivity and Usage</h3>
    <p>The Application requires an internet connection. Please be aware that the Service Provider
        does not assume responsibility for certain aspects.
        Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi
        or
        provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if
        the
        Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have
        exhausted your data allowance.</p>

    <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile
        network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from
        your
        mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other
        third-party
        charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including
        roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region
        or
        country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
        which
        you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill
        payer.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the
        application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains
        charged.
        If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service
        Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>

    <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is
        important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all
        times,
        they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it
        available
        to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you
        experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p>

    <h3>Updates and Termination</h3>
    <p>The Application may be updated periodically. You agree to accept updates. The Service
        Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time, and your rights to use it will
        end upon termination.</p>

    <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>These Terms & Conditions may be updated periodically. Changes will be posted on this
        page.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 2, 2025</p>
